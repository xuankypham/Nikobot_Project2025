Nikobot was designed by two students Nico Steynberg and Irvin Jurado in 2020 at Waikato University, 
this project was supervised by three professors Mrs Melanie Ooi, Mr Ye Chow Kuang, and  Mr Nick Pickering.
In Nov 2025, Xuan Ky another student of Master Electrical and Electronic Engineering Practice who wanted to improve the controller 
of this robot car from Arduino Mega 2560 to ESP32 with Raspberry PI and applied IoT  MQTT and Image Processing by using Python with Yolo V10 or V11 in this application.
Although this work is done and has more advantages in the IoT and Image processing technique, however, the control Algorithms such as PID for Motor Speed still
need to improve to make the speed control smooth. An image dataset for training robots to recognize traffic signs also needs to improve in quality.
Besides that, this upgrading project is better than the original one when a new  protocol and website for control and monitoring were implemented with very
clearly, it is easy for users to control and manage robots over the internet.
Two cameras were installed to monitor the robot during traveling, and GPS was to displace the robot's position over Google Maps. Moreover, many analog sensors were installed to 
indicate robot data such as distance sensors, current sensors, voltage sensors, and so on...etc.
Thanks to Waikato University especially Mrs Malenie who gave very good advice for me to start and improve my project while working with this robot car.
Thanks to Waikato University provided me with a good environment for me to work and improve this project, especially the support from the Lab Technician 
Mr. Benson gave me many advice and helped me during my time working on this project.
